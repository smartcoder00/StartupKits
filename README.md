# Startup Kits

You’ve designed, built and emulated your cellular application on a workstation. Now it’s time to port it to a mobile platform and test it with real-world connectivity. Startup platforms and startup kits from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) are your next step.

Startup platforms expose I/Os, GPIOs, hardware interfaces and other peripheral connectors into mobile processors, and QTI has combined modules based on those processors with carrier boards to help create this series of startup platforms:

Qualcomm® MDM9206 IoT Modem startup platform (Quectel BG96 module) — for cellular applications with low power requirements
Qualcomm(R) MDM9207 IoT Modem startup platform (Quectel EC25 module) — for edge computing applications and LTE
Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 210 startup platform (Quectel SC20 module based on Snapdragon 210) — for smart IoT applications and gateways
Snapdragon 660 startup platform (Quectel SC66 module based on the Snapdragon 660) — for compute-intensive workloads in artificial intelligence and machine learning
To accompany the startup platforms, QTI offers startup kits containing the documentation, sample scripts and build instructions needed to quickly port your applications and get them running on the platforms.

Startup kits are designed for any developers who work with the modules, regardless of application. They contain highly accessible, easy-to-use APIs from the module vendors themselves.

Ideal users for startup platforms and kits include startups, incubators, internal groups, universities and design-transfer programs. Support is provided by local QTI labs.

Qualcomm Snapdragon, Qualcomm MDM9206, Qualcomm MDM9207 and Qualcomm SDM660 are products of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc., and/or its subsidiaries.
